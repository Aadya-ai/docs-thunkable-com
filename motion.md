## Position 

### Move Sprite To

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_move_to.png)

Move the sprite to the x and y location specified in the block

### Set Sprite Position

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_set_coord.png)

Set the sprite's X, Y, Z or Angle value to a specific position.

Change the sprites X, Y, Z or Angle value by a given amount.

**Note**: Sprite angle is measured in degrees, so should be a value between 0 and 360. 

### Get Sprite Position

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_get_coord.png)

Get the sprite's current X, Y, Z or Angle value.

**Note**: Sprite angle is measured in degrees, so should be a value between 0 and 360

## Pointer

### Get Pointer Value

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_pointer.png)

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_pointer2.png)

Get the X, Y, or Angle of the where the user tapped on the canvas

## Behavior

On the canvas, it's possible to make a sprite either draggable or to have it fixed in position.

Similarly, it's possible for other sprites to pass through a sprite, or it can be made impassable. 

Finally, if a sprite is moving, it's possible to programatically cause it to stop moving. 

### Set Draggable or Passable 

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_set_draggable.png)

Set the draggability or passability of the sprit

### Get Draggable or Passable

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_get_draggable.png)

Get draggability of the sprite

### Stop All Sprites

![](.gitbook/assets/mov_stop_sprites.png)

Stop all sprites that are moving.

## Examples

### Move Sprite to Pointer

When the user clicks on the canvas these blocks will move the `Sprite1` to the location that was touched.
