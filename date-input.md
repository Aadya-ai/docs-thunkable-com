# Date Input

A Date Input component is helpful when you want the user of your app to easily select a specific date using the native Android or iOS date picker

## Getting Started 

The Date Input component needs no set-up \(Woohoo!\). Just drag and drop the component into your project. As a bonus, the current date will automatically show up as a label.

When a user of your app taps on the Date Input, it will automatically launch the native Android or iOS date pickers.

## Set the Date Format

You can set the format of the date by simply choosing your desired format from the `Style` property

## Save the Date

The date that a user selects will show up automatically in the Date Input label but if you want to save the date somewhere to be uploaded later, you'll need to add a block like the one below.
