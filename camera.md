## Take Photo

The camera block has three outputs:

 **i\) Photo:** This saves the photo taken by the user.

**ii\) DidUserCancel:** This is either true or false depending on whether the user cancelled taking the picture

**iii\) Error:** Indicates if there was an error when the photo was taken

![These blocks say that when Button1 is clicked, open the camera. Then set the photo taken to be displayed in an Image component. ](.gitbook/assets/camera.png)

![These blocks say that when Button1 is clicked, open the camera. If the user does not cancel the action, one of two things will happen: if there is an error, display the error message on a Label. If there is not an error, set the photo taken to be displayed in an Image component. ](.gitbook/assets/cameraqualified.png)
